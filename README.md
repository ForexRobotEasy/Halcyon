## Description

The Halcyon Forex Robot is an automated trading software designed for scalping the EUR/USD currency pair. It uses a combination of five strategies to place trades and aims to achieve consistent profitability.

## How It Works

The Halcyon Forex Robot uses the MetaQuotes Language 5 (MQL5) for coding and executing trades. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The `OnInit()` function is called during initialization. You can add any necessary initialization code in this function.

2. **Deinitialization**: The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is removed or the terminal is closed. You can add any necessary deinitialization code in this function.

3. **Trading Logic**: The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the price. This is where the trading logic is implemented. The code should contain the following steps:

    - Place trades based on the five strategies: Implement the trading rules and conditions for each strategy.
    
    - Calculate trade profitability: Track the profitability of each trade based on entry and exit prices.
    
    - Close trades: Implement the logic to close trades based on exit conditions.
    
    - Print trading results: Display the trading results, including profit/loss, number of trades, etc.
    
    - Add necessary comments to the code: Document the logic and any important information within the code.
    
    - Logical conclusion: Provide a summary or conclusion of the trading activity.
